            <p className="feature-description">
              The cane uses ultrasonic sensors to find obstacles in front of the user and a low-cost LiDAR sensor to scan the ground. This mix helps to detect objects and vertical dangers like stairs, ramps, and uneven surfaces in real time.

            <p className="feature-description">
              Communication with the user is non-visual, using haptic feedback (specific vibrations) and voice alerts. This makes sure the user gets clear instructions and can react to dangers immediately without being distracted.

            <p className="feature-description">
              The device includes a mobile connection module to constantly send GPS location data and sensor readings to the server. This continuous data transfer is essential for system data processing and monitoring features.

            <p className="feature-description">
              The cane's electronic design is efficient to ensure low power consumption and a long-lasting battery, which is very important for daily movement. An internal microcontroller manages the sensor readings before they are sent.
